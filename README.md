- In the program, randÄ±m birthdays were generated so that the number of people in the room (n) would be 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20, respectively, and the number of overlaps was recorded wheren there were individuals born on the same day of the week. This process was repeated 15 times for each n value, and the table containing the test results and the mean overlap for each n value is listed on the screen.
